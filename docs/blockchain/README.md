## 区块链定义

关键字：交易、账本、脚本

> A blockchain is a consensus-based, electronic ledger which is implemented as a computer based decentralised, distributed system made up of blocks which in turn are made up of transactions. Each transaction is a data structure that encodes the transfer of control of a digital asset between participants in the blockchain system, and includes at least one input and at least one output. Each block contains a hash of the previous block to that blocks become chained together to create a permanent, unalterable record of all transactions 25 which have been written to the blockchain since its inception. Transactions contain small programs known as scripts embedded into their inputs and outputs, which specify how and by whom the outputs of the transactions can be accessed. On the Bitcoin platform, these scripts are written using a stack-based scripting language.

区块链是基于共识的数字账本，基于计算机去中心实现，由交易构成的账本组成的分布式系统。
每笔交易是这样一种数据结构，编码实现数字资产控制权在区块链参与方之间的转移，包含至少一个输入和输出。
每个账本包含上个账本的哈希，构成不可篡改的链条。
交易包含了脚本，定义如何及谁能接受交易输出，在比特币平台上，这些脚本使用基于栈的脚本语言编写。

## 挖矿

是一种机制使区块链实现去中心化且保证安全

当成创造新币是狭隘理解

矿工验证交易，记账

## PoS 权益证明 

穷人没有闲钱出借来参与投票，富人游戏

工作量证明中，矿工需要持续付出和改善，而权益证明中只是一次性出借
